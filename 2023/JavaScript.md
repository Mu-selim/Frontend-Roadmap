### **_Project: Weather Application_**

Requirements:

- Develop a weather application that displays current weather information based on user input.
- The application should fetch weather data from a weather API and present it in a user-friendly format.
- Use modern JavaScript techniques and DOM manipulation to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Features:

- Input field: Users can enter a location (e.g., city name) to retrieve weather information.
- Weather display: Present the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- Icon representation: Show weather icons corresponding to the current weather conditions.
- Responsive design: Ensure the application looks good on different screen sizes.

Tools:

- HTML and CSS: Structure the application and create a visually appealing user interface.
- JavaScript: Fetch weather data from an API, handle user input, and update the DOM dynamically.
- Fetch API: Make HTTP requests to the weather API and retrieve weather data.
- JSON parsing: Extract the necessary weather information from the API response.
- Asynchronous programming: Handle asynchronous operations to retrieve and display the weather data.

## **Advanced Level (Weeks 6-8)**

### **_Courses_**

- [Advanced JavaScript Concepts by Andrei Neagoie](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-javascript-concepts): Explores advanced topics, design patterns, clean code practices, and JavaScript frameworks.

### **_Topics_**

1. Closures and scope
2. Prototypes and inheritance
3. Event handling and event-driven architecture
4. Modules and module bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, etc.)
5. Testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
6. Performance optimization and profiling
7. Security best practices

### **_Project: To-Do List Application Enhancement_**

Requirements:

- Enhance the previous todo list application by implementing additional features and improving the user experience.
- Apply advanced JavaScript concepts and best practices to optimize the codebase and add more functionality.

Features:

- Data persistence: Save the todo list data in local storage, so users can access their tasks even after closing and reopening the application.
- Drag-and-drop functionality: Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them within the list.
- Task filters: Implement filters to display tasks based on their completion status (e.g., show only completed tasks, show only active tasks).
- Animations: Add smooth transitions and animations when tasks are added, completed, or deleted.

Tools:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Build upon the previous todo list application's codebase and extend its functionality.
- Local storage: Store and retrieve the todo list data in the browser's local storage.
- Drag-and-drop libraries (e.g., Dragula, Sortable): Implement the drag-and-drop functionality.
- JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React): Utilize a framework to simplify state management and enhance the application.

## **Final Project: Movie Recommendation Web Application**

### _Requirements:_

- Create a web application that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and search queries.
- Utilize external APIs to retrieve movie data, such as movie titles, descriptions, ratings, and images.
- Implement a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and receive personalized recommendations.

### _Features:_

1. Movie Search:
   - Users can enter search queries to find movies by title, genre, or actor.
   - Display search results with relevant movie information, including ratings and poster images.
   - Clicking on a movie should display detailed information, such as a synopsis and cast.
2. Movie Reviews and Ratings:
   - Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for movies they have watched.
   - Display average ratings and user reviews alongside movie details.
3. User Interaction:
   - Implement features for users to add movies to their watchlist or mark movies as watched.
   - Provide options for users to share movie recommendations with friends via social media.
4. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure the application is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

### _Tools:_

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Develop the frontend application using these core technologies.
- Frameworks or libraries: Utilize frontend frameworks or libraries (e.g., React) for building the user interface and managing state.
- Movie APIs: Integrate movie-related APIs, such as the IMDb API or The Movie Database (TMDb) API, to fetch movie data.
- Authentication: Implement user authentication using frameworks like Firebase Authentication or Auth0 for personalized recommendations and user profiles.
- Database: Utilize a database (e.g., Firebase Firestore, MongoDB) to store user information, movie ratings, and reviews.
- UI libraries: Enhance the user interface with UI libraries like Material-UI or Tailwind.

### _Additional Suggestions:_

- Implement features like movie trailers, similar movie recommendations, or the ability to create and join movie discussion forums.
- Apply advanced JavaScript concepts and best practices, such as modular code architecture, efficient data fetching, and error handling.
- Consider incorporating additional technologies like Redux for state management, GraphQL for API queries, or Express.js for a backend API if desired.

Remember to customize the project based on your preferences and goals, and feel free to add your own creative touches. The Movie Recommendation Web Application provides an opportunity to showcase your skills in frontend development, JavaScript, and integration with external APIs. Best of luck with your final project!
